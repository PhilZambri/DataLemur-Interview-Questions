WITH TweetsbyUserId AS (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(msg)
  FROM tweets

### ðŸ“Œ [LinkedIn | Easy | Matching Skills](https://datalemur.com/questions/matching-skills)

Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.
Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT candidate_id 
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3;
ORDER BY candidate_id;
```
If there were duplicates:

```sql
SELECT candidate_id 
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;
```

### ðŸ“Œ [McKinsey | Hard | 3-Topping-Pizzas](https://datalemur.com/questions/pizzas-topping-cost)

Given a list of pizza toppings, consider all the possible 3-topping pizzas, and print out the total cost of those 3 toppings. Sort the results with the highest total cost on the top followed by pizza toppings in ascending order.  
Break ties by listing the ingredients in alphabetical order, starting from the first ingredient, followed by the second and third.

My Solution:
```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',', p1.topping_name, p2.topping_name, p3.topping_name) AS pizza,
      p1.ingredient_cost + p2.ingredient_cost + p3.ingredient_cost AS total_cost
FROM pizza_toppings p1 CROSS JOIN pizza_toppings p2 CROSS JOIN pizza_toppings p3
WHERE p1.topping_name < p2.topping_name 
      AND p2.topping_name < p3.topping_name
ORDER BY total_cost DESC, pizza;
```

### ðŸ“Œ [FAANG | Hard | Department vs Company Salary](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-department-company-salary-comparison)

Write a query to compare the average salary of employees in each department to the company's average salary for March 2024. Return the comparison result as 'higher', 'lower', or 'same' for each department. Display the department ID, payment month (in MM-YYYY format), and the comparison result.

My Solution:
```sql
WITH employee_avg_salary AS(
  SELECT e.employee_id, name, salary, department_id, payment_date,
    avg(salary)OVER() AS overall_avg_salary,
    avg(salary)OVER(PARTITION BY department_id) AS dept_avg_salary
  FROM employee AS e JOIN salary AS s on e.employee_id = s.employee_id
  WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date) = 3
)

SELECT DISTINCT department_id, TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'MM-YYYY') AS payment_date, 
  CASE
    WHEN dept_avg_salary < overall_avg_salary THEN 'lower'
    WHEN dept_avg_salary > overall_avg_salary THEN 'higher'
    ELSE 'same'
  END AS comparison
FROM employee_avg_salary;
```

Alternate Solution:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department_id,
       TO_CHAR(payment_date,'MM-YYYY'),
       CASE
            WHEN AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) < AVG(amount) OVER () THEN 'lower'
            WHEN AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) = AVG(amount) OVER () THEN 'same'
            WHEN AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) > AVG(amount) OVER () THEN 'higher'
       END
FROM employee AS emp INNER JOIN salary AS s
ON emp.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date) = 3
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM payment_date) = 2024;
```

### ðŸ“Œ [Stripe | Hard | Repeated Payments](https://datalemur.com/questions/repeated-payments)

Sometimes, payment transactions are repeated by accident; it could be due to user error, API failure or a retry error that causes a credit card to be charged twice.  
Using the transactions table, identify any payments made at the same merchant with the same credit card for the same amount within 10 minutes of each other. Count such repeated payments.

My Solution:
```sql
WITH time_diff AS (
  SELECT transaction_id, merchant_id, credit_card_id, transaction_timestamp, amount,
    transaction_timestamp -
    LAG(transaction_timestamp)OVER(PARTITION BY merchant_id, credit_card_id, amount ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS prev_time_diff
  FROM transactions
)

SELECT COUNT(prev_time_diff) AS payment_count
FROM time_diff
WHERE prev_time_diff NOTNULL 
      AND EXTRACT(epoch FROM prev_time_diff)/60 <= 10;
```

Alternative Solution:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS payment_count
FROM transactions AS t1
JOIN transactions AS t2
ON t1.merchant_id = t1.merchant_id
  AND t1.credit_card_id = t2.credit_card_id
  AND t1.amount = t2.amount
  AND t1.transaction_timestamp < t2.transaction_timestamp
  AND t2.transaction_timestamp - t1.transaction_timestamp <= INTERVAL '10 MINUTES';
```

### ðŸ“Œ [Amazon | Hard | Server Utilization Time](https://datalemur.com/questions/total-utilization-time)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimize server usage.  
Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.

My Solution:
```sql
WITH time_diff AS(
  SELECT server_id, status_time, session_status, 
    status_time - LAG(status_time, 1)OVER(PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY status_time) AS prev_time
  FROM server_utilization
  ORDER BY server_id, status_time
)

SELECT FLOOR(EXTRACT(epoch FROM SUM(prev_time))/86400) AS total_uptime_days
FROM time_diff
WHERE session_status = 'stop';
```

Alternative Solution:
```sql
WITH time_diff AS(
  SELECT server_id, status_time, session_status, 
    status_time - LAG(status_time, 1)OVER(PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY status_time) AS prev_time
  FROM server_utilization
  ORDER BY server_id, status_time
)

SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM JUSTIFY_HOURS(SUM(prev_time))) AS total_uptime_days
FROM time_diff
WHERE session_status = 'stop';
```
